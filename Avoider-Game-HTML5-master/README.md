# Avoider Game (Revamped)

A rebuilt version of my original HTML5 avoider game, cleaned up, modular, and easier to expand.  
Still simple, still fun, but smarter under the hood.

Built with vanilla JS and Canvas  
Reworked with some extra guidance along the way  
Work in progress, evolving into a mini game engine  
Made for learning, experimenting, and future projects
