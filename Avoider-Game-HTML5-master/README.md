# Avoider-Game-HTML5
Avoider Game made in HTML5. 
Made this game a while ago as a learning experince.
Its gone thru a few versions, and I have had it up on my
porfolio site. I am rebuilding for the sake of learning more maybe? I have alredy gone thru and cleaned it up a bit and fixed a few things that bothered me last time. But it still could use some help. Putting it up here for me to work on and if others want to check it out.
